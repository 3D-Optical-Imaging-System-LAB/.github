## Hi there üëã

- [Integral Imaging Systems](https://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201708034064487.page)
- Dehazing algorithm
  - [Peplography](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9997511)
  - [Adaptive Removal via Mask for Scatter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10973090)
- [Digital Holographic Microscopy]
- [Security]
- [Night Vision]
**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
